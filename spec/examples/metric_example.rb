# TODO: Convert these tests to use a fake metric class rather than shared examples
#
# Right now, we're using shared examples that we include in every metric type's tests
# to validate the behaviour of the base metric class.
#
# This makes it difficult to test certain behaviour, as the interfaces of those metric
# types differ and these tests can end up needing to know about them.
#
# You can see that in the tests for #get, which depend on `type` which isn't defined in
# this file. The test files that include these shared examples have to do so with a block
# that provides the `type` variable.
#
# This cropped up in a much worse way when trying to test the code that makes sure label
# values are all strings. Writing a test here that gets included in all the real metric
# implementations is near impossible. You need your test to call a different method to
# alter a metric value (e.g. `set`, `increment` or `observe` depending on the metric type)
# which means having each concrete metric type's tests passing us a lambda that we can
# call agnostically of the metric type.
#
# The resultant code is confusing to follow, so we opted to duplicate those tests in each
# metric type's test file.
#
# Changing this file to implement a fake metric class (e.g. `FakeTestCounter`) would let
# us easily test the functionality of the base `Prometheus::Client::Metric` without
# getting caught up in the specifics of the real metric types.
